# quotation-web-app

Sanitized replica of the full-stack quotation system I built for MultyViajes. Designed, developed, and deployed to streamline the quoting process to reduce manual and cut quote time. This version uses dummy data only.

Outcome: 89% fewer manual steps and 52% faster quote time.

Tech Stack: MongoDB Atlas, Node.js/Express REST API, hosted on Render; front-end on Netlify (HTML/JavaScript/CSS).
